// how to declare constant and variables in js 

const accId =1234
let accemail ="manav@gm.com"

// we dont use var in js because of issue in block scope and function scope

var accpass ="1212"

//if you dont give any value to the variable then it will show you undefined
let accname


accemail="harsh@gm.com"
accpass="4545"

//we use a table here to show all fields in one time 

console.table([accId,accemail,accpass,accname])
