//Asynchronus code

// default java script{
// javascript is synchronus - code will be execute one by one

// javascript is single threaded language- everything execute on a single thread }

/*execution context
execute one line of code at a time
console.log1
console.log2 - each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing
CALL STACK - a stack is created and the code is executed into it which follows lifo rule 
MEMORY HEAP 
*/

/*
two types of code is written in js
 
1.BLOCKING CODE- block the flow of program

2. NON BLOCKING CODE - does not block execution

*/

/**
 * In synchronus js the code is executed on js single thread 
 * In asynchrnus js the code is executed by using api and then api are called by register call back to tell at which event you have to give response then it goes to task queue and then to call stack again
